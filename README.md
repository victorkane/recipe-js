## Installing a minimum environment toolset

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), which includes the Node Package Manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), by visiting the homepage and clicking on the install button in order to download and install the latest binary for your operating system.
* Install the DVCS (distributed version control system) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) which also has binary packages for all operating systems on its homepage. Learn Git immediately by reading at least the first three chapters of the free online [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Global dependencies for testing throughout the course

Tools local to our app (like the Karma test runner) are automatically included locally when you provision your static server with the `npm install` command (see below). But as we'll see it's convenient to install the karma command-line interface globally as well:

````
npm install -g karma-cli
````

That way you don't have to execute `./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start` every time you run your tests. You can just do `karma`.

And we'll install `bower`, another package manager very commonly used in JavaScript projects.

````
npm install -g bower
````

And [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/)

````
npm install -g protractor
webdriver-manager update
````

Note: Selenium assumes that you have a Java runtime installed.

## Instructions for reviewing each lesson's code.

````
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/victorkane/recipe-js.git
cd recipe-js/

# Provision static server and development dependencies
export NODE_ENV=development
npm install
bower install

# [For versions that have a gulpfile and are not running on a server you can use browser-sync directly with your open browser and the app will come up automatically]
gulp dev-watch

# [For versions that have a gulpfile but are running on a server]
gulp dev
# Run server
node server.js

# Change to a branch lesson locally
git checkout lesson01-01
````

## Special note for lessons involving changes to NodeJS server

After checking out branches involving changes to the NodeJS server `server.js` (for example, **branch lesson04-01** involves changes to the NodeJS server dependencies due to the implementation of the RESTful API), you will need to execute a one-time `npm update` to install them so the server will work. If the server is running, stop it, do the `npm update` and start it up again with `node server.js`.

## Instructions for performing the local testing for each lesson's code

### Unit tests

````
# Install testing dependencies locally and start karma
karma start
````

### End-to-end testing

In one terminal we start selenium:

````
webdriver-manager start
````

In another terminal we run the e2e tests:

````
protractor test/e2e/protractor.conf.js
````
